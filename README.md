"# OBS-Progress-Bar-Hotkey-Plugin" 
This OBS script allows you select a image or any source of your liking, and turn it into a progress bar that you can configure with hotkeys!
In order to set this up, go to tools -> scripts -> and then click the + and add the python script. This only works when OBS is running in normal mode, not safe mode.
After you do this, reload and then select which source you want to become the progress bar in the drop down menu.
Now go to your keybinds and set what you want to be the 
1. Increase Hotkey
2. Decrease Hotkey
3. Reset Hotkey
4. Sustain Hotkey

The script has some nice animations, and fades out when not used. 
Also, you can select the progress bar container (the thing tha surrounds the progress bar) and sound effects that play when the keybinds are pressed or the progress bar becomes full.
